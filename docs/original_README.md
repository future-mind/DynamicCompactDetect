# DynamicCompact-Detect: Efficient Object Detection for Resource-Constrained Environments

This repository implements a novel object detection architecture that combines the efficiency of YOLOv10 with the global reasoning capabilities of transformers from RT-DETR, optimized for resource-constrained environments.

## Research Approach

Our research focuses on improving object detection performance for resource-constrained environments through the following innovations:

### 1. Architecture Innovations

- **Hybrid CNN-Transformer Backbone**: Combining YOLOv10's efficient backbone with lightweight transformer blocks for improved global reasoning
- **Dynamic Sparse Attention**: Implementing an attention mechanism that selectively activates computational pathways based on input complexity
- **Structured Pruning and Quantization**: Applying advanced model compression techniques to reduce model size while preserving accuracy

### 2. Training Innovations

- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from larger models (YOLOv10-L/X) to our compact model
- **Self-Supervised Pretraining**: Leveraging unlabeled data to improve feature representations

## Comparison with State-of-the-Art

Our model aims to outperform existing lightweight detection models on standard benchmarks:

| Model | mAP (COCO) | Parameters | FLOPs | FPS (CPU) |
|-------|------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| YOLOv10-N | 37.6% | 2.8M | 8.7G | 35 |
| YOLOv10-S | 44.9% | 11.4M | 28.6G | 30 |
| RT-DETR-T | 46.5% | 11M | 30G | 28 |
| **Ours** | TBD | ~10M | ~25G | TBD |
