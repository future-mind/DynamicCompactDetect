**Authors:** Abhilash Chadhar, Divya Athya

## Abstract

This paper presents DynamicCompactDetect (DCD), a lightweight object detection model designed for edge devices with limited computational resources. Building upon the YOLOv8 architecture, DCD introduces several optimizations that maintain high accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and memory footprint. Our model achieves 5.71% higher mAP50 and 11.75% higher precision compared to YOLOv8n, with comparable inference speed and identical model size. Most notably, DCD demonstrates a 10x improvement in cold-start performance, making it particularly suitable for intermittent detection tasks on resource-constrained devices. We provide comprehensive benchmarks across various hardware platforms and demonstrate DCD's effectiveness in real-world applications.

## 1. Introduction

Object detection remains a fundamental computer vision task with applications spanning autonomous vehicles, surveillance, robotics, and augmented reality. While significant progress has been made in improving detection accuracy, deploying these models on edge devices presents unique challenges due to limited computational resources, power constraints, and real-time requirements.

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models has gained popularity for real-time object detection due to their efficient single-stage architecture. YOLOv8, in particular, offers a good balance between accuracy and speed. However, even the smallest variant, YOLOv8n, faces challenges in edge deployment scenarios:

1. **Cold-start latency**: The time required to load the model and perform the first inference is often prohibitively high for intermittent detection tasks.
2. **Memory efficiency**: While compact in size, the runtime memory requirements can exceed the capabilities of many edge devices.
3. **Dynamic adaptation**: Most models lack the ability to adjust their computational footprint based on available resources.

DynamicCompactDetect addresses these limitations by introducing architectural modifications and optimization techniques specifically designed for edge deployment. Our approach focuses on maintaining detection accuracy while significantly improving cold-start performance and enabling dynamic adaptation to varying computational constraints.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Architecture

DynamicCompactDetect builds upon the YOLOv8n architecture with several key modifications:

1. **Streamlined backbone**: We redesigned the feature extraction backbone to reduce computational complexity while preserving feature representation capacity. This involved:
   - Replacing certain convolutional layers with depthwise separable convolutions
   - Optimizing the channel dimensions across network stages
   - Introducing a lightweight attention mechanism at strategic points in the network

2. **Efficient neck design**: The neck component, responsible for feature fusion across different scales, was modified to:
   - Reduce the number of cross-connections between feature levels
   - Implement more efficient upsampling and downsampling operations
   - Incorporate residual connections to improve gradient flow

3. **Dynamic computation paths**: We introduced conditional execution paths that allow the model to adjust its computational footprint based on available resources or required accuracy:
   - Primary path: Full model execution for maximum accuracy
   - Efficient path: Reduced computation for faster inference with slight accuracy trade-off
   - Minimal path: Bare minimum computation for extremely resource-constrained scenarios

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of DynamicCompactDetect, highlighting the key components and modifications from the base YOLOv8n model.

### 2.2 Training Methodology

DynamicCompactDetect was trained using a multi-stage approach:

1. **Initial training**: The model was first trained on the COCO dataset using standard detection loss functions (classification, objectness, and bounding box regression).

2. **Knowledge distillation**: We employed knowledge distillation from a larger YOLOv8 model to improve the feature representation capacity of our compact model.

3. **Dynamic path optimization**: The three computational paths were jointly optimized using a specialized loss function that balances accuracy across different computational budgets.

4. **Cold-start optimization**: We applied specific optimizations to improve model initialization and first-inference latency, including weight quantization and strategic tensor memory layout.

The training process utilized the following hyperparameters:
- Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay of 0.001
- Learning rate: 0.01 with cosine annealing schedule
- Batch size: 64
- Input resolution: 640Ã—640
- Data augmentation: Mosaic, random affine transformations, and color jittering

### 2.3 Implementation Details

DynamicCompactDetect was implemented using PyTorch and the Ultralytics YOLO framework. The model weights are stored in a compact format that enables fast loading on edge devices. We developed custom ONNX export utilities to ensure compatibility with a wide range of deployment targets, including:

- ARM-based processors (Raspberry Pi, mobile devices)
- NVIDIA Jetson platforms
- Intel Neural Compute Stick
- WebAssembly for browser-based deployment

The final model has a size of 6.23MB, identical to YOLOv8n, but with significantly improved cold-start performance and detection accuracy.

- mAP50-95: Mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95
- Precision and Recall
- Inference time (ms)
- Cold-start latency (ms)
- Memory usage (MB)

### 3.2 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Models

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Performance Benchmarks

DynamicCompactDetect achieved impressive results across all evaluation metrics. On the COCO val2017 dataset, our model attained:

- mAP50: 43.0% (5.71% higher than YOLOv8n)
- Precision: 67.5% (11.75% higher than YOLOv8n)
- Recall: 45.3% (2.7% higher than YOLOv8n)

The inference speed was measured at 21.07ms per image on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which is comparable to YOLOv8n's 19.81ms. However, the most significant improvement was observed in cold-start performance, where DynamicCompactDetect was 10 times faster than YOLOv8n.

Figure 2 illustrates the performance comparison between DynamicCompactDetect and other models in terms of accuracy versus inference time.

### 4.2 Dynamic Adaptation Performance

One of the key features of DynamicCompactDetect is its ability to dynamically adjust its computational footprint based on available resources. We evaluated this capability by measuring the model's performance under different computational constraints:

- 100% resources: 43.0% mAP50
- 80% resources: 41.2% mAP50
- 60% resources: 38.7% mAP50
- 40% resources: 35.9% mAP50
- 20% resources: 30.5% mAP50

Figure 3 shows how DynamicCompactDetect maintains higher performance compared to other models as computational resources decrease.

### 4.3 Cold-Start Performance

Cold-start performance is critical for applications that require intermittent object detection, such as triggered surveillance cameras or on-demand analysis. DynamicCompactDetect achieved a cold-start latency of 24.5ms, compared to 245.1ms for YOLOv8n, representing a 10x improvement.

Table 3 presents the cold-start performance comparison across different edge devices, demonstrating the consistent advantage of DynamicCompactDetect in this crucial metric.

### 4.4 Memory Footprint

Despite maintaining the same model size as YOLOv8n (6.23MB), DynamicCompactDetect showed improved memory efficiency during runtime:

- Peak memory usage: 35.2MB (vs. 47.8MB for YOLOv8n)
- Steady-state memory: 28.7MB (vs. 42.3MB for YOLOv8n)

This reduction in memory footprint makes DynamicCompactDetect suitable for deployment on highly resource-constrained devices.

1. **Improved accuracy**: The 5.71% increase in mAP50 and 11.75% increase in precision compared to YOLOv8n indicate that our architectural modifications enhance the model's detection capabilities without increasing its size.

2. **Cold-start performance**: The 10x improvement in cold-start latency is particularly significant for intermittent detection tasks, enabling quick response times even when the model is not continuously running.

3. **Dynamic adaptation**: The ability to maintain reasonable accuracy under varying computational constraints makes DynamicCompactDetect highly versatile across different deployment scenarios.

The ablation studies reveal that each component of our approach contributes meaningfully to the overall performance. The streamlined backbone and efficient neck design provide moderate improvements in accuracy and speed, while the dynamic computation paths and cold-start optimizations deliver substantial benefits in their respective areas.

### 5.2 Limitations and Future Work

Despite the promising results, DynamicCompactDetect has several limitations that present opportunities for future research:

1. **Small object detection**: Like many compact models, DynamicCompactDetect struggles with very small objects. Future work could explore specialized branches or attention mechanisms to improve performance in this area.

2. **Model quantization**: While we applied basic quantization techniques, more advanced approaches such as mixed-precision quantization or quantization-aware training could further reduce the model size and improve inference speed.

3. **Hardware-specific optimizations**: Our current implementation focuses on general compatibility across edge devices. Developing hardware-specific versions could unlock additional performance improvements.

4. **Extended dynamic capabilities**: The current dynamic adaptation mechanism could be enhanced to consider factors beyond computational resources, such as input complexity or required detection confidence.
