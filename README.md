# DynamicCompactDetect (DCD)

A lightweight yet powerful object detection model designed for edge devices, featuring significant speed improvements over YOLOv8n while maintaining detection accuracy.

## Overview

DynamicCompactDetect (DCD) is an optimized object detection model that dramatically reduces inference time while maintaining detection capabilities comparable to YOLOv8n. It's specifically engineered for resource-constrained environments like edge devices, IoT systems, and mobile applications.

### Key Features
- **Dramatically Faster Inference**: 89.1% faster than YOLOv8n (26.69ms vs 244.94ms)
- **Equivalent Detection Capability**: Detects the same number of objects as YOLOv8n
- **Comparable Model Size**: Identical file size to YOLOv8n (6.23MB)
- **Small Trade-off in Confidence**: Only 9.4% lower confidence scores than YOLOv8n
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with any framework that supports YOLO models

## Architecture

DynamicCompactDetect employs several innovative architectural components:

1. **RepConv Module**: Reparameterizable convolution blocks that use parallel 3x3 and 1x1 convolutions during training but fuse them into a single efficient convolution during inference.

2. **ELAN Blocks**: Efficient Layer Aggregation Network blocks with progressive channel expansion that improve information flow through multiple parallel paths.

3. **Dynamic Architecture**: Configurable backbone with width and depth multipliers that allow for flexible scaling based on deployment requirements.

4. **Optimized Feature Pyramid**: Enhanced feature pyramid implementation for better multi-scale object detection.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/future-mind/dynamiccompactdetect.git
   cd dynamiccompactdetect
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   
   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download pre-trained models if they don't exist (the scripts will automatically check):
   ```
   mkdir -p models
   # The models will be downloaded automatically when running scripts
   ```

## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### 1. Running Benchmarks

To evaluate the performance of DynamicCompactDetect and compare it with YOLOv8n:

```bash
# Generate benchmarks for both models
python scripts/generate_benchmarks.py

# Generate a detailed comparison report
python scripts/generate_report.py
```

This will:
- Run inference on test images with both models
- Measure inference time, detection count, and confidence
- Save benchmark data to `results/benchmarks/`
- Generate a detailed comparison report in `results/comparisons/model_comparison_report.md`

### 2. Visualizing Detections

To visually compare detection results:

```bash
# Compare detections on test images
python scripts/compare_models.py
```

This will:
- Run both models on test images
- Generate side-by-side comparisons
- Create performance visualizations
- Save results to `results/comparisons/`

### 3. Fine-tuning the Model

To fine-tune DynamicCompactDetect on your custom dataset:

```bash
# Fine-tune the model
python scripts/finetune_dynamiccompactdetect_v8.py \
  --data path/to/your/dataset.yaml \
  --epochs 50 \
  --batch-size 16 \
  --img 640
```

### 4. Generating Research Paper Data

To generate data and figures for the research paper:

```bash
# Generate paper data
python scripts/generate_paper_data.py
```

This will:
- Run comprehensive benchmarks
- Generate all figures and tables
- Prepare data for the research paper
- Save results to `results/research_paper/`

### 5. Running the Complete Pipeline

For a complete end-to-end run:

```bash
# Unix-like systems (macOS/Linux)
./run_dcd_pipeline.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)

## Integration in Your Projects

### Basic Inference

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the model
model = YOLO('models/dynamiccompactdetect_finetuned.pt')

# Run inference
results = model('path/to/image.jpg')

# Process results
for r in results:
    print(f"Detected {len(r.boxes)} objects")
    
    # Access individual detections
    for box in r.boxes:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box.xyxy[0]  # Get box coordinates
        conf = box.conf[0]            # Get confidence score
        cls = int(box.cls[0])         # Get class index
        print(f"Object {cls} at {(x1, y1, x2, y2)} with confidence {conf:.2f}")
```

### Deployment Considerations

For optimal performance when deploying DynamicCompactDetect:

1. **Memory Optimization**: The model requires approximately 42MB of RAM during inference
2. **Batch Processing**: For processing multiple images, use batching to increase throughput
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: The model benefits from GPU acceleration but is optimized for CPU inference
4. **Quantization**: INT8 quantization can further reduce memory requirements with minimal impact on accuracy

## Architectural Innovations

DynamicCompactDetect introduces several key architectural innovations:

1. **RepConv Module**: This innovative module uses parallel 3x3 and 1x1 convolutions during training that are fused into a single efficient convolution during inference. The mathematical transformation preserves the same function while dramatically reducing computation.

2. **Progressive ELAN Blocks**: The Efficient Layer Aggregation Network blocks use progressive channel expansion in deeper layers, improving information flow through multiple parallel paths while maintaining computational efficiency.

3. **Dynamic Architecture Design**: The model architecture features configurable width and depth multipliers, allowing flexible scaling based on deployment requirements. This enables creating variants optimized for different hardware constraints.
